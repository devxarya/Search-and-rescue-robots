<h1>Search-and-rescue-robots
<h2>Platform: AVR studio 6 and Firebird V
<h4>The problem consists of the arena of 4x4 grids. Search robot starts traversing along with scanning all the cells for blocks without repetition and avoiding any obstacle. The search robot sends the block coordinates to rescue robot. The rescue robot removes these block and traverses back to medical camp and avoiding collision with search robot. The path planning algorithm developed was generic and estimated completion time around 7 minutes
